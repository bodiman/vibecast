In addition to the mcp server, we are going to need a module that   │
│   allows translation between our storage format and human-readable    │
│   excel files so that we can easily visualize data. The server        │
│   should have endpoints that allow us to upload excel files for       │
│   ingestion and receive excel exports from the data storage.
